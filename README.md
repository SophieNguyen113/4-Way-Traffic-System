# 4-Way-Traffic-System
/* ==========================================================
 * 4 â€“ Way Traffic System Project  
 * Author: Sophie Nguyen
 * October 2022  
 * 
 * Designed a 4-way traffic system simulation in Proteus Professional software with pedestrian button to interrupt the system and allow the pedestrian to cross.  
 * Created an Arduino program, an open-source platform that uses a programming language based on C++, to compile and debug the project.
 * 
 * This is a 4-way Arduino traffic system that has a main and a pedestrian lighting circuit.  
 * As soon as the pedestrian button is pressed, the system waits until the main process attempts to jump to the next state before performing a pedestrian cycle. 
 * The pedestrian cycle will allow pedestrians to cross the street for a predefined period of time. 
 * After the time elapsed, the system resumes the main traffic control cycle from the state where the pedestrian cycle interrupts occurred.
